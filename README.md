# CMPLXSYS511Project


Final project for complex systems 511 course


Theoretical underpinning from: https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0921344919304446#fig0025

However entire simulation produced by myself


* Structure of files:
    * Main
        * runs the actual program and conducts batch run analysis
        * for conducting analysis-janky version will have to go in and manually change for different settings
    * Inputs
        * provide respective parameters for simulation
    * data folder
        * folder containing respective Michigan and Washington data necessary to run simulations

**Key** In order to run Washington simulation you have to download the respective shapefile (and other files) from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-nation-u-s-current-county-and-equivalent-national-shapefile **and** store under the data folder in a folder called *entireCountryShapefile*
